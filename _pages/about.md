I am a 5th year Ph.D. candidate at [Department of ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. [Pramod Viswanath](https://web3.princeton.edu/members/). I obtained my Bachelor Degree in Electronic Engineering in Tsinghua University. My research interest is in decentralized consensus protocols (blockchains).
