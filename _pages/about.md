I am an incoming assistant professor [Thrust of Fintech](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/four-hubs/society-hub/financial-technology) at HKUST (GZ) starting this fall. I obtained a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. [Pramod Viswanath](https://web3.princeton.edu/members/). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor Degree in Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University. My research interest is in decentralized consensus protocols (blockchains).

Here is a more detailed [CV]({{site.url}}/assets/CV.pdf) and [Publications]({{site.url}}/publications/).



<span style="color:red">**I am looking for strongly motivated postgraduate students (MPhil and PhD), research assistants, and summer interns, on research topics including blockchain infrastructure (layer-1, layer-2, cross-chain), CBDCs, DeFi, and the intersection of AI and blockchains.
